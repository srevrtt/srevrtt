# About Me
Hello! My name is Srevrtt (pronounced "sir everett"), and I am passionate about mainly game development and UI design/desktop app development. I am 15 years old and have been coding since I was 8. I am interested in creating game engines and GUI applications from scratch.

So yeah, that's it. I'm not going to put anything cringy aside from my Github stats to flex on other developers for how bad I am at this lol...
