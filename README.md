# About Me
Hello! My name is Srevrtt (pronounced "sir everett"), and I am passionate about mainly game development and UI design/desktop app development. I am 15 years of age and have been coding since I was 8 (in other words, I've been coding for half my life). I am interested in creating game engines and GUI applications from scratch.

Outside of software, I enjoy fixing/refurbishing laptops, geography, bushcraft/primitive building, and being outside (not very normal for many other developers... jk).
